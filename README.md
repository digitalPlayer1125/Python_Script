# Python_Script
Collection of some of my Python scripts.

# Script - 1
The file auto.bat is the batch file, which automatically runs the  python script keyn.py. So, the aim is to satisfy user's hunger for songs. So, by taking the keyboard input through the pynput library in python, it becomes easy to detect whenever a user presses 1 or 2, to either hear Starboy or Major Lazor Remix. The primarily aim is to be able to make choices between songs while doing any kinda' work.
